Along with this, and few other reasons I elaborate below, I decided to try out fast.ai library which is build on top of PyTorch instead of Keras. Despite being used to working in Keras, I didn't find it difficult to navigate fast.ai and the learning curve is quite fast to implement advanced things as well!\n",

ULMFiT proposed to tune each layer with different learning rates, {η1,…,ηℓ,…,ηL}, where η is the base learning rate for the first layer, ηℓ is for the ℓ-th layer and there are L layers in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Slanted triangular learning rates (STLR)** refer to a special learning rate scheduling that first linearly increases the learning rate and then linearly decays it.

       "xxbos i was introduced by a former - friend and guide on this game , and i really enjoyed it . xxmaj it 's very time consuming , and i 've never been too much into xxup rpg 's , but this one was a lot of fun . 7 / 10,xxbos xxmaj if you 've ever played and enjoyed xxmaj starwars : xxmaj battlefront in your nostalgic childhood days , then planetside 2 may very well be in your ball park , and will knock several home runs to boot . xxmaj it will blow your ideas of massive scale battles in a video game out of the water , xxunk only by a few select titles . xxmaj soon upon entry you will learn that as a singular soldier your affect on the waging war is minuet at best , but your duty as an individual in a faction is as important as the people fighting by your side . planetside 2 is a game best played when working with others , or simply causing havoc with your friends . xxmaj there 's no feeling that can compare to flying well above the ground in a gunship , firing off rounds from a xxmaj xxunk - an explosive cannon - upon the unsuspecting targets below . xxmaj well co - xxunk attacks see uncountable masses of tanks rolling across the continent , much to the defender 's disdain . xxmaj the sheer scale of planetside is impressive at its worst , spectacular at its best . xxmaj being a free - to - play xxup mmo , the war never ceases . xxmaj there is a vast pool of weapons , resources and upgrades at your disposal . xxmaj station cash makes for the inevitable real - world currency of an xxup mmo , allowing you to boost your experience or purchase vanity items . xxmaj everything else can be bought with xxmaj certs , a currency that is earned through play . xxmaj in the end , the experience you have or wish to have is entirely up to you .,xxbos i 've tried a few different mmos , and normally i burn out of them pretty fast ( tab targetting etc is not very engaging ) . xxmaj with xxmaj neverwinter i find the gameplay fun enough that i have managed to level up to 64 quite pleasantly . i am a big fan of xxmaj dungeons and xxmaj dragons , so it is a lot of fun to see monsters and locations from the famous xxmaj forgotten xxmaj realms setting . xxmaj the zones are mostly pretty cool to romp around in and i find the combat fun , which is good because almost all quests are of the kill x monsters type . i have set myself up with a controller by using a key mapping software called xxunk , which is working really well and lets me chill out and play it with controller , which it is designed for in any case . 64 levels in and i 've not spent a penny , which is pretty good !,xxbos xxmaj life traverse is exceptional for forceful shooters . xxmaj hardly a month goes by without new virtual fields xxunk up and appealing you into some fresh conflict , and only a few surely understood xxunk make sense of how to oversee dynamic player bases even a year after their hidden release . xxmaj what 's more , a short time later there 's xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 . xxmaj released in 2007 , this class - based commendable is so far going strong particularly into its seventh year , in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering . xxmaj since xxunk 's one of a kind xxup tf2 review , the entertainment has xxunk from different upgrades and made the skip to a permitted to - play plan of activity . xxmaj the middle action pits two xxunk of players against each other in a battle to get centers , move a truck , or take an organizer case . xxmaj the objective is always xxunk clear ; it 's the exchange between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting . xxmaj the convenient scout , the xxunk generous , the xxunk pro , the xxunk specialist , the irritating xxunk , the tricky see , the feisty pyro , the shaky trooper , and the fundamentally more - risky demoman all have exceptional weapons , attributes , and limits that supplement each other and xxunk in bundle ways . xxmaj encounters can vary xxunk depending upon the match sort and the xxunk of each gathering , and this xxunk is dire to xxup tf2 's long - standing xxunk . xxmaj when you leave the door as a mind - boggling with a specialist near to , you 're a forcing unfriendly xxunk , yet if a spy hovers around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pyro , it can all come xxunk in a matter of seconds . xxmaj master xxunk can cover expected foe ways , however rocket - ricocheting warriors have an ability for finding xxunk courses and raining dangerous going from above . xxmaj you may think you have an also fragile scout dead to rights , just to be xxunk by a baseball and beat the life out of . xxmaj as you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a quit xxunk of your cheerful killer , it 's hard not to chuckle at the sheer grouping of ways you can meet an unfavorable end . xxmaj besides , engaging jokes , insane outfits , and sensational host build up this sprightly tone . xxmaj clearly , this inside component has endured for by far most of xxup tf2 's future , so if you quit playing it two or three years earlier and return for a couple matches , you 'll find things are to a great degree surely understood . xxmaj taking in the ropes and getting the hang of your picked part is still a delightful information , and acing pushed frameworks does n't just make you deadlier ; it gives you more options for how to approach fight . xxmaj keeping your choices open is still xxunk too , in light of the way that being versatile with your choice of character can help you refrain from ending up on a xxunk imbalanced squad . xxmaj it is xxmaj team xxmaj fortress , taking all things into account . xxmaj regardless , however there is much that has stayed steady about the inside redirection , there have been some noticeable changes consistently , and moreover ordinary xxunk of new weapons and things . xxmaj of the few things available in the online store , some can be opened through play , while others must be acquired with genuine money . xxmaj from little xxunk that cost not precisely a dollar to huge packs that cost hundreds , there 's a broad assortment of ways to deal with adjust your experience . xxmaj some of the things offer just a vigorous twist on the entertainment 's starting now xxunk toon snappy . xxmaj you can buy tops , shirts , shoes , and other xxunk gear to xxunk up like a character from xxmaj adult xxmaj swim or wear spooky xxunk xxunk that you can wear just in the midst of xxmaj halloween or a full moon . xxmaj notwithstanding the likelihood that you do n't support spending for any of this stuff , it 's diverting to see some visual grouping as you endeavor to light your adversaries on fire . xxmaj the best difference from the redirection 's beginnings comes in the accommodating mode , xxmaj mann versus xxmaj machine . xxmaj in it , you and a few other human players must maintain a strategic distance from swarms of xxunk incarnations of xxup tf2 's classes from passing on a bomb to your base . xxmaj the money you pick up from xxunk robots can be spent on mid - organize climbs to your qualities and weaponry , which can be essential to accomplishment . xxmaj for sure , even on the most easy level , the robot armed forces are adequately wild to test the guts of a messy gathering . xxmaj this is a mode where absolutely xxunk weapon choices and defensive frameworks can mean the xxunk among succeeding and attempting , endeavor xxunk . xxmaj you can play this mode to no end , yet you wo n't be met all requirements to increase exceptional prizes or complete difficulties unless you pay a dollar for a xxmaj tour of xxmaj duty ticket . xxmaj notwithstanding the way that it does n't have the xxunk xxunk of centered play , the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately committed to see it through . xxmaj however , xxunk is the honest to goodness draw , and the xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 gathering can completely be engaged . xxmaj on a couple of servers , you might be scolded for xxunk cracks of xxunk , while on others , you might be welcomed with pleasing tips and xxunk . xxmaj you can even demand help on particular servers and be xxunk with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tips through talk . xxmaj the society around xxup tf2 is a charming one , not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight , yet for their imaginative attempts in arranging new weapons , things , and maps that have since ended up being a bit of the experience . xxmaj it feels like a gathering of managers , without whom the delight may well have dwindled away and gone into obsolete nature years earlier . xxmaj staying imperative even a year after release is extraordinary for an engaged shooter , yet , here 's xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 , still xxunk after seven years in the business . xxmaj every so often it feels like comparable diversion you could have played back then , and at various times it feels like no one will ever extremely nail class - based shooter competition the way xxup tf2 does . xxmaj the experience has created during the time without exchanging off what made it so extraordinary regardless , so however your permitted to - play choices may have extended altogether in the past couple of years , there are few that do it furthermore xxmaj team xxmaj fortress xxunk reviews are retrieved from the xxmaj internet and xxunk through a succession of xxunk tools three times both for humour and to save time . xxmaj in my religion , this is known as xxunk ) , but you can call it \" xxmaj xxunk \" ),xxbos i was excited about this game on steam . xxmaj free to play and all , awesome . i had played this back when if was first released on my phone , and i enjoyed it . xxmaj it had a short life back then , but it was good . xxmaj that being said , i still enjoy it , but with one small issue that has ruined it for me . xxmaj radscorpions . xxmaj they are so op that it makes the game not as fun , and more frustrating . i end up rushing a room , and getting one of those little b xxrep 5 * ds . xxmaj they drain my energy below xxunk , which renders my xxunk rooms un - capable of producing anything . xxmaj they have very hard to kill , they move randomly . i usually end up with 4 - 5 dead dwellers . xxmaj after the attack i am usually out of xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj so i have to rush rooms just to gain back enough energy to keep my dwellers alive , and i get another xxunk xxmaj radscorpion . xxmaj maybe introduce them later into the game , when at least all my dwellers have weapons ? xxmaj but as of right now , i wo n't be playing for awhile . i am annoyed and frustrated . xxmaj otherwise , i do like the updates , the missions are cool . xxmaj the new rooms are fun . xxmaj being able to build weapons and outfits gives the game depth . xxmaj if they made xxunk less powerful and random , i will come back , until then xxunk .\n",

       "xxbos xxmaj pros : xxmaj great art xxunk xxunk simple to learn : the more you play , the better you xxunk and legends somewhat well balanced ( it was for a long time , at the time of this review some patches just changed the meta but i 'm sure it 'll be xxunk economic system : entierly free to play , the game relies on people buying skins ( same as xxmaj league of xxunk : xxmaj matchmaking needs to be re - xxunk you have low internet speed , you ca n't play xxunk - of - game chat is a xxunk , the game is awesome , but the multiplayer system around it needs some work .,xxbos xxmaj early xxmaj access reviewthis game is absolutely amazing . xxmaj it 's my most played game and i enjoy playing all day everyday . xxmaj brawlhalla is rather polished for something still in the beta - ish stages , obviously needing more updates to further increase it 's general greatness . xxmaj i'm a diamond player and really enjoy playing with my xxunk definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a game to have there on the side at the cost of nothing ( although i ve spent about $ xxunk xxup xxunk on cosmetics xd ) it is definitely the best free to play small little game in my xxunk problem however i commonly encounter is the somewhat toxic community , yes there are really friendly people but most of the time people tend to say something nasty if you win or loose regardless , i guess that 's just what happens with these types of games : alot of salty players . xxmaj other than that . legendary game for all i 'd say . but of course if you 're not into this sort of game then obviously you would n't like it : xxunk for me , i 'm a 2v2 competitive player ranking # 1 aus and top 30 xxunk several times throughout seasons 1 - 6 , however casual play is just as fun if you want to create your own mini - rules , which i have personally experienced before . xxmaj try doing xxmaj no sigs , only sigs , or just playing your worst legends with some friends , xxmaj brawlhalla is not limited to the conventional fighting , you can even xxunk some bots ! : dedit : i would like to say that i 'm doing this edit as of now to get my badge for the steam autumn sales and whatnot , however i did nominate it for the \" no apologies \" award as i feel many people feel negatively about this game ( possible because of their lack of skill xxup ;d ) and i would like to say xxunk that i still love the game although i have nt played a whole lot in general across the recent months .,xxbos xxmaj infestation | xxmaj the xxunk you read , i would like to say that i have over 300 hours on this game before steam release . xxmaj infestation | xxmaj the newz , is an official rework of the original ( and bad ) title xxmaj infestation | xxmaj survivor xxmaj stores , formerly known as xxmaj the warz , xxmaj the newz is being worked on by a whole new development team called xxmaj fredaikis xxup ab , xxmaj there is not a single dev from the original xxup iss on this development team . xxmaj everyone knows xxmaj the warz and how bad the game was . xxmaj it was riddled with hackers , xxmaj it was xxup seriously pay to win , loot was rare , so it made hackers even more populated , xxmaj it was full of bugs that devs did not patch , and lets be honest ... there was no content . xxmaj all there was to do is xxunk ... on the other hand , xxmaj fredaikis xxup ab , the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did , xxmaj they are listening to the community , and trying their best to make a game that you guys want . xxmaj they have released an anticheat called xxup mlg anticheat , xxup this anticheat was designed xxup just for this game , i have over 300 hours before steam and i have only got cheated xxup once . i repeat xxunk to the lack of content the previous game had , they made about 10 different xxup pvp server maps , so you can hop into it and xxup pvp right away , they made a custom xxup br , xxmaj they added airdrops , ( these drop about every hour ) on official servers , xxmaj they have revamped the xxup ui , they have added xxup alot of guns that the original xxup iss did not have . and armor , helmets etc . xxup and xxup they xxup added xxup skins <3 xxmaj traders dream ! xxmaj they have completely removed the xxmaj pay 2 win aspect of the game , now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market . xxmaj they have not removed ( xxup gc ) xxmaj gold credits , you can use this to purchase a private server to loot , or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place . xxup this xxup is xxup just xxup to xxup support xxup this xxup game xxup and xxup keep xxup it xxunk of you guys need to understand , they need to have a few things they can make money off of . a game is not free , they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that 10,000 people are playing on .,xxbos i have never considered giving this game anything but praise until now . xxmaj now i 'm voting with my review to try and urge valve to bring back quickplay and casual pubs into the game . xxmaj not this xxrep 6 ♥ overwatch / any - xxunk xxrep 4 ♥ ing - shooter lobby based queueing xxrep 7 ♥ t. i do n't give a xxrep 4 ♥ how low the queue times are it still takes up to two minutes between games just for server connection . i used to only have to do that after literal hours of fun on whatever map i chose . xxmaj good players , bad players , tryhards , friendlies . xxmaj all together . xxmaj all having fun on whatever map they wanted . xxmaj in whatever region they wanted , for as long as they wanted without any queueing or connecting . xxmaj this change is utter insanity . xxmaj everyone was excited about matchmaking but i doubt a single person was hoping they would replace the xxup entire game with it . xxmaj for xxup years xxunk has been my favorite activity . xxmaj the only thing in my life that guaranteed fun and an escape from xxrep 7 ♥ t. i xxunk when i was happy , sad , lonely or with friends laughing and having fun . xxmaj this game is the most important activity is my life and has been since i started playing 5 years ago . xxmaj pubs have always been my place to just go and be free and have fun without a worry or care beyond that tryhard soldier i 'm trying to stop from dominating me , or the free to play xxunk that crit me to death with his wrench . xxmaj this game can be very competitive and i enjoy that aspect , but above all else it is fun . xxmaj it has to stay fun . xxmaj please xxmaj valve . xxmaj please give us back the best part of this game .,xxbos xxmaj hmm well this game is xxunk bad or good depending what you 're looking for . xxmaj social experience , lacking but present , community is nice but absent minded , questing is solo - oriented but there is group quests as well , xxmaj zen market where you buy stuff is rediculously overpriced no one would buy anything from there unless a steep , steep , very steep incentive / sale was on , however most anything you need can be bought with diamonds / gold ; there 's a lack of ingame xxunk that must be overcome by strong inventory management from the get - xxunk becomes less annoying once you learn what to sell / keep / stack ) not to mention this is an xxup mmo and its a xxunk version of that ( you can play this game even the xxup pc version with a controller using xxmaj xpadder xxunk software and it works great really smooth actually no complaints there - its sad the lazy developers have n't offered this yet to the xxup pc hardcore fans that do n't know how to setup xxmaj xpadder on their own ) which caters to xxunk button configurations etc . so its easy to pick up and play . xxmaj would i suggest caution on spending money on this game ? xxmaj in the xxup zen store for example ? xxmaj yes . xxmaj the prices are inflated and you do n't get much value there . xxmaj pathetic really . xxmaj it puts the developer in a bad light , prices are so high no one can understand xxunk motive except to cater to a certain xxunk meanwhile no one plays the game because those that would pay a small $ 10 or $ 20 in the xxmaj zen store are discouraged because believe it or not , that wo n't buy you xxrep 6 ♥ for this game . xxmaj we 're talking hundreds of dollers to get anything worthwhile . xxmaj pathetic . xxmaj the developers are out of tough , its all i can think of to say . i think they are completely wrong in their approach . xxmaj stay away from the xxmaj zen store . xxmaj that said , you can play at least 2 character slots for free , the quests are well designed , most everything is voiced over , its an xxup mmo so there 's tons to do from crafting to questing , to pvp to dungeon crawling its all here etc . xxmaj you can play the game entirely for free and there 's a bunch of cool classes but you 're limited by 2 character slots unless you pay 300 xxmaj zen for another ( that s a rediculous cost ) so yea except for that its all good here . xxmaj if you want to pick up and play and have fun with some xxup d&d you can do so in a variety of ways no issues here . xxmaj its the overall structure of the game that suffers ( forcing you to spend money in the xxmaj zen store but really you do n't have to but you could its what 's backward here there is little xxunk between free and paid ) . xxmaj do i recommend this game ? xxmaj sure , the strong graphics , sound , action - oriented combat ( its like xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj xxunk without the blocking mechanic or xxup gw2 ) its fine and deep skill trees , the xxup d&d settings and ruleset , the variety of character classes however the xxmaj zen store and marketing scheme of this game is xxup bad so you must choose caution here . xxmaj xxunk community pressure will change their approach , but for now you put up with it . xxmaj you can play this game completely free , its worth a play through at least . xxmaj how it lasts or endgame ? xxmaj well lets just say they 're working on that . xxmaj its a thumbs up for now but i might change my mind in the future . xxmaj so far hours of free fun , i 've spent no money on this game and my experience has not suffered all that much though i think it is somewhat a pay - to - win structure .\n",

       "xxbos i was introduced by a former - friend and guide on this game , and i really enjoyed it . xxmaj it 's very time consuming , and i 've never been too much into xxup rpg 's , but this one was a lot of fun . 7 / 10,xxbos xxmaj if you 've ever played and enjoyed xxmaj starwars : xxmaj battlefront in your nostalgic childhood days , then planetside 2 may very well be in your ball park , and will knock several home runs to boot . xxmaj it will blow your ideas of massive scale battles in a video game out of the water , xxunk only by a few select titles . xxmaj soon upon entry you will learn that as a singular soldier your affect on the waging war is minuet at best , but your duty as an individual in a faction is as important as the people fighting by your side . planetside 2 is a game best played when working with others , or simply causing havoc with your friends . xxmaj there 's no feeling that can compare to flying well above the ground in a gunship , firing off rounds from a xxmaj xxunk - an explosive cannon - upon the unsuspecting targets below . xxmaj well co - xxunk attacks see uncountable masses of tanks rolling across the continent , much to the defender 's disdain . xxmaj the sheer scale of planetside is impressive at its worst , spectacular at its best . xxmaj being a free - to - play xxup mmo , the war never ceases . xxmaj there is a vast pool of weapons , resources and upgrades at your disposal . xxmaj station cash makes for the inevitable real - world currency of an xxup mmo , allowing you to boost your experience or purchase vanity items . xxmaj everything else can be bought with xxmaj certs , a currency that is earned through play . xxmaj in the end , the experience you have or wish to have is entirely up to you .,xxbos i 've tried a few different mmos , and normally i burn out of them pretty fast ( tab targetting etc is not very engaging ) . xxmaj with xxmaj neverwinter i find the gameplay fun enough that i have managed to level up to 64 quite pleasantly . i am a big fan of xxmaj dungeons and xxmaj dragons , so it is a lot of fun to see monsters and locations from the famous xxmaj forgotten xxmaj realms setting . xxmaj the zones are mostly pretty cool to romp around in and i find the combat fun , which is good because almost all quests are of the kill x monsters type . i have set myself up with a controller by using a key mapping software called xxunk , which is working really well and lets me chill out and play it with controller , which it is designed for in any case . 64 levels in and i 've not spent a penny , which is pretty good !,xxbos xxmaj life traverse is exceptional for forceful shooters . xxmaj hardly a month goes by without new virtual fields xxunk up and appealing you into some fresh conflict , and only a few surely understood xxunk make sense of how to oversee dynamic player bases even a year after their hidden release . xxmaj what 's more , a short time later there 's xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 . xxmaj released in 2007 , this class - based commendable is so far going strong particularly into its seventh year , in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering . xxmaj since xxunk 's one of a kind xxup tf2 review , the entertainment has xxunk from different upgrades and made the skip to a permitted to - play plan of activity . xxmaj the middle action pits two xxunk of players against each other in a battle to get centers , move a truck , or take an organizer case . xxmaj the objective is always xxunk clear ; it 's the exchange between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting . xxmaj the convenient scout , the xxunk generous , the xxunk pro , the xxunk specialist , the irritating xxunk , the tricky see , the feisty pyro , the shaky trooper , and the fundamentally more - risky demoman all have exceptional weapons , attributes , and limits that supplement each other and xxunk in bundle ways . xxmaj encounters can vary xxunk depending upon the match sort and the xxunk of each gathering , and this xxunk is dire to xxup tf2 's long - standing xxunk . xxmaj when you leave the door as a mind - boggling with a specialist near to , you 're a forcing unfriendly xxunk , yet if a spy hovers around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pyro , it can all come xxunk in a matter of seconds . xxmaj master xxunk can cover expected foe ways , however rocket - ricocheting warriors have an ability for finding xxunk courses and raining dangerous going from above . xxmaj you may think you have an also fragile scout dead to rights , just to be xxunk by a baseball and beat the life out of . xxmaj as you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a quit xxunk of your cheerful killer , it 's hard not to chuckle at the sheer grouping of ways you can meet an unfavorable end . xxmaj besides , engaging jokes , insane outfits , and sensational host build up this sprightly tone . xxmaj clearly , this inside component has endured for by far most of xxup tf2 's future , so if you quit playing it two or three years earlier and return for a couple matches , you 'll find things are to a great degree surely understood . xxmaj taking in the ropes and getting the hang of your picked part is still a delightful information , and acing pushed frameworks does n't just make you deadlier ; it gives you more options for how to approach fight . xxmaj keeping your choices open is still xxunk too , in light of the way that being versatile with your choice of character can help you refrain from ending up on a xxunk imbalanced squad . xxmaj it is xxmaj team xxmaj fortress , taking all things into account . xxmaj regardless , however there is much that has stayed steady about the inside redirection , there have been some noticeable changes consistently , and moreover ordinary xxunk of new weapons and things . xxmaj of the few things available in the online store , some can be opened through play , while others must be acquired with genuine money . xxmaj from little xxunk that cost not precisely a dollar to huge packs that cost hundreds , there 's a broad assortment of ways to deal with adjust your experience . xxmaj some of the things offer just a vigorous twist on the entertainment 's starting now xxunk toon snappy . xxmaj you can buy tops , shirts , shoes , and other xxunk gear to xxunk up like a character from xxmaj adult xxmaj swim or wear spooky xxunk xxunk that you can wear just in the midst of xxmaj halloween or a full moon . xxmaj notwithstanding the likelihood that you do n't support spending for any of this stuff , it 's diverting to see some visual grouping as you endeavor to light your adversaries on fire . xxmaj the best difference from the redirection 's beginnings comes in the accommodating mode , xxmaj mann versus xxmaj machine . xxmaj in it , you and a few other human players must maintain a strategic distance from swarms of xxunk incarnations of xxup tf2 's classes from passing on a bomb to your base . xxmaj the money you pick up from xxunk robots can be spent on mid - organize climbs to your qualities and weaponry , which can be essential to accomplishment . xxmaj for sure , even on the most easy level , the robot armed forces are adequately wild to test the guts of a messy gathering . xxmaj this is a mode where absolutely xxunk weapon choices and defensive frameworks can mean the xxunk among succeeding and attempting , endeavor xxunk . xxmaj you can play this mode to no end , yet you wo n't be met all requirements to increase exceptional prizes or complete difficulties unless you pay a dollar for a xxmaj tour of xxmaj duty ticket . xxmaj notwithstanding the way that it does n't have the xxunk xxunk of centered play , the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately committed to see it through . xxmaj however , xxunk is the honest to goodness draw , and the xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 gathering can completely be engaged . xxmaj on a couple of servers , you might be scolded for xxunk cracks of xxunk , while on others , you might be welcomed with pleasing tips and xxunk . xxmaj you can even demand help on particular servers and be xxunk with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tips through talk . xxmaj the society around xxup tf2 is a charming one , not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight , yet for their imaginative attempts in arranging new weapons , things , and maps that have since ended up being a bit of the experience . xxmaj it feels like a gathering of managers , without whom the delight may well have dwindled away and gone into obsolete nature years earlier . xxmaj staying imperative even a year after release is extraordinary for an engaged shooter , yet , here 's xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 , still xxunk after seven years in the business . xxmaj every so often it feels like comparable diversion you could have played back then , and at various times it feels like no one will ever extremely nail class - based shooter competition the way xxup tf2 does . xxmaj the experience has created during the time without exchanging off what made it so extraordinary regardless , so however your permitted to - play choices may have extended altogether in the past couple of years , there are few that do it furthermore xxmaj team xxmaj fortress xxunk reviews are retrieved from the xxmaj internet and xxunk through a succession of xxunk tools three times both for humour and to save time . xxmaj in my religion , this is known as xxunk ) , but you can call it \" xxmaj xxunk \" ),xxbos i was excited about this game on steam . xxmaj free to play and all , awesome . i had played this back when if was first released on my phone , and i enjoyed it . xxmaj it had a short life back then , but it was good . xxmaj that being said , i still enjoy it , but with one small issue that has ruined it for me . xxmaj radscorpions . xxmaj they are so op that it makes the game not as fun , and more frustrating . i end up rushing a room , and getting one of those little b xxrep 5 * ds . xxmaj they drain my energy below xxunk , which renders my xxunk rooms un - capable of producing anything . xxmaj they have very hard to kill , they move randomly . i usually end up with 4 - 5 dead dwellers . xxmaj after the attack i am usually out of xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj so i have to rush rooms just to gain back enough energy to keep my dwellers alive , and i get another xxunk xxmaj radscorpion . xxmaj maybe introduce them later into the game , when at least all my dwellers have weapons ? xxmaj but as of right now , i wo n't be playing for awhile . i am annoyed and frustrated . xxmaj otherwise , i do like the updates , the missions are cool . xxmaj the new rooms are fun . xxmaj being able to build weapons and outfits gives the game depth . xxmaj if they made xxunk less powerful and random , i will come back , until then xxunk .\n",

       "xxbos xxmaj pros : xxmaj great art xxunk xxunk simple to learn : the more you play , the better you xxunk and legends somewhat well balanced ( it was for a long time , at the time of this review some patches just changed the meta but i 'm sure it 'll be xxunk economic system : entierly free to play , the game relies on people buying skins ( same as xxmaj league of xxunk : xxmaj matchmaking needs to be re - xxunk you have low internet speed , you ca n't play xxunk - of - game chat is a xxunk , the game is awesome , but the multiplayer system around it needs some work .,xxbos xxmaj early xxmaj access reviewthis game is absolutely amazing . xxmaj it 's my most played game and i enjoy playing all day everyday . xxmaj brawlhalla is rather polished for something still in the beta - ish stages , obviously needing more updates to further increase it 's general greatness . xxmaj i'm a diamond player and really enjoy playing with my xxunk definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a game to have there on the side at the cost of nothing ( although i ve spent about $ xxunk xxup xxunk on cosmetics xd ) it is definitely the best free to play small little game in my xxunk problem however i commonly encounter is the somewhat toxic community , yes there are really friendly people but most of the time people tend to say something nasty if you win or loose regardless , i guess that 's just what happens with these types of games : alot of salty players . xxmaj other than that . legendary game for all i 'd say . but of course if you 're not into this sort of game then obviously you would n't like it : xxunk for me , i 'm a 2v2 competitive player ranking # 1 aus and top 30 xxunk several times throughout seasons 1 - 6 , however casual play is just as fun if you want to create your own mini - rules , which i have personally experienced before . xxmaj try doing xxmaj no sigs , only sigs , or just playing your worst legends with some friends , xxmaj brawlhalla is not limited to the conventional fighting , you can even xxunk some bots ! : dedit : i would like to say that i 'm doing this edit as of now to get my badge for the steam autumn sales and whatnot , however i did nominate it for the \" no apologies \" award as i feel many people feel negatively about this game ( possible because of their lack of skill xxup ;d ) and i would like to say xxunk that i still love the game although i have nt played a whole lot in general across the recent months .,xxbos xxmaj infestation | xxmaj the xxunk you read , i would like to say that i have over 300 hours on this game before steam release . xxmaj infestation | xxmaj the newz , is an official rework of the original ( and bad ) title xxmaj infestation | xxmaj survivor xxmaj stores , formerly known as xxmaj the warz , xxmaj the newz is being worked on by a whole new development team called xxmaj fredaikis xxup ab , xxmaj there is not a single dev from the original xxup iss on this development team . xxmaj everyone knows xxmaj the warz and how bad the game was . xxmaj it was riddled with hackers , xxmaj it was xxup seriously pay to win , loot was rare , so it made hackers even more populated , xxmaj it was full of bugs that devs did not patch , and lets be honest ... there was no content . xxmaj all there was to do is xxunk ... on the other hand , xxmaj fredaikis xxup ab , the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did , xxmaj they are listening to the community , and trying their best to make a game that you guys want . xxmaj they have released an anticheat called xxup mlg anticheat , xxup this anticheat was designed xxup just for this game , i have over 300 hours before steam and i have only got cheated xxup once . i repeat xxunk to the lack of content the previous game had , they made about 10 different xxup pvp server maps , so you can hop into it and xxup pvp right away , they made a custom xxup br , xxmaj they added airdrops , ( these drop about every hour ) on official servers , xxmaj they have revamped the xxup ui , they have added xxup alot of guns that the original xxup iss did not have . and armor , helmets etc . xxup and xxup they xxup added xxup skins <3 xxmaj traders dream ! xxmaj they have completely removed the xxmaj pay 2 win aspect of the game , now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market . xxmaj they have not removed ( xxup gc ) xxmaj gold credits , you can use this to purchase a private server to loot , or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place . xxup this xxup is xxup just xxup to xxup support xxup this xxup game xxup and xxup keep xxup it xxunk of you guys need to understand , they need to have a few things they can make money off of . a game is not free , they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that 10,000 people are playing on .,xxbos i have never considered giving this game anything but praise until now . xxmaj now i 'm voting with my review to try and urge valve to bring back quickplay and casual pubs into the game . xxmaj not this xxrep 6 ♥ overwatch / any - xxunk xxrep 4 ♥ ing - shooter lobby based queueing xxrep 7 ♥ t. i do n't give a xxrep 4 ♥ how low the queue times are it still takes up to two minutes between games just for server connection . i used to only have to do that after literal hours of fun on whatever map i chose . xxmaj good players , bad players , tryhards , friendlies . xxmaj all together . xxmaj all having fun on whatever map they wanted . xxmaj in whatever region they wanted , for as long as they wanted without any queueing or connecting . xxmaj this change is utter insanity . xxmaj everyone was excited about matchmaking but i doubt a single person was hoping they would replace the xxup entire game with it . xxmaj for xxup years xxunk has been my favorite activity . xxmaj the only thing in my life that guaranteed fun and an escape from xxrep 7 ♥ t. i xxunk when i was happy , sad , lonely or with friends laughing and having fun . xxmaj this game is the most important activity is my life and has been since i started playing 5 years ago . xxmaj pubs have always been my place to just go and be free and have fun without a worry or care beyond that tryhard soldier i 'm trying to stop from dominating me , or the free to play xxunk that crit me to death with his wrench . xxmaj this game can be very competitive and i enjoy that aspect , but above all else it is fun . xxmaj it has to stay fun . xxmaj please xxmaj valve . xxmaj please give us back the best part of this game .,xxbos xxmaj hmm well this game is xxunk bad or good depending what you 're looking for . xxmaj social experience , lacking but present , community is nice but absent minded , questing is solo - oriented but there is group quests as well , xxmaj zen market where you buy stuff is rediculously overpriced no one would buy anything from there unless a steep , steep , very steep incentive / sale was on , however most anything you need can be bought with diamonds / gold ; there 's a lack of ingame xxunk that must be overcome by strong inventory management from the get - xxunk becomes less annoying once you learn what to sell / keep / stack ) not to mention this is an xxup mmo and its a xxunk version of that ( you can play this game even the xxup pc version with a controller using xxmaj xpadder xxunk software and it works great really smooth actually no complaints there - its sad the lazy developers have n't offered this yet to the xxup pc hardcore fans that do n't know how to setup xxmaj xpadder on their own ) which caters to xxunk button configurations etc . so its easy to pick up and play . xxmaj would i suggest caution on spending money on this game ? xxmaj in the xxup zen store for example ? xxmaj yes . xxmaj the prices are inflated and you do n't get much value there . xxmaj pathetic really . xxmaj it puts the developer in a bad light , prices are so high no one can understand xxunk motive except to cater to a certain xxunk meanwhile no one plays the game because those that would pay a small $ 10 or $ 20 in the xxmaj zen store are discouraged because believe it or not , that wo n't buy you xxrep 6 ♥ for this game . xxmaj we 're talking hundreds of dollers to get anything worthwhile . xxmaj pathetic . xxmaj the developers are out of tough , its all i can think of to say . i think they are completely wrong in their approach . xxmaj stay away from the xxmaj zen store . xxmaj that said , you can play at least 2 character slots for free , the quests are well designed , most everything is voiced over , its an xxup mmo so there 's tons to do from crafting to questing , to pvp to dungeon crawling its all here etc . xxmaj you can play the game entirely for free and there 's a bunch of cool classes but you 're limited by 2 character slots unless you pay 300 xxmaj zen for another ( that s a rediculous cost ) so yea except for that its all good here . xxmaj if you want to pick up and play and have fun with some xxup d&d you can do so in a variety of ways no issues here . xxmaj its the overall structure of the game that suffers ( forcing you to spend money in the xxmaj zen store but really you do n't have to but you could its what 's backward here there is little xxunk between free and paid ) . xxmaj do i recommend this game ? xxmaj sure , the strong graphics , sound , action - oriented combat ( its like xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj xxunk without the blocking mechanic or xxup gw2 ) its fine and deep skill trees , the xxup d&d settings and ruleset , the variety of character classes however the xxmaj zen store and marketing scheme of this game is xxup bad so you must choose caution here . xxmaj xxunk community pressure will change their approach , but for now you put up with it . xxmaj you can play this game completely free , its worth a play through at least . xxmaj how it lasts or endgame ? xxmaj well lets just say they 're working on that . xxmaj its a thumbs up for now but i might change my mind in the future . xxmaj so far hours of free fun , i 've spent no money on this game and my experience has not suffered all that much though i think it is somewhat a pay - to - win structure .\n",

       "xxbos i was introduced by a former - friend and guide on this game , and i really enjoyed it . xxmaj it 's very time consuming , and i 've never been too much into xxup rpg 's , but this one was a lot of fun . 7 / 10,xxbos xxmaj if you 've ever played and enjoyed xxmaj starwars : xxmaj battlefront in your nostalgic childhood days , then planetside 2 may very well be in your ball park , and will knock several home runs to boot . xxmaj it will blow your ideas of massive scale battles in a video game out of the water , xxunk only by a few select titles . xxmaj soon upon entry you will learn that as a singular soldier your affect on the waging war is minuet at best , but your duty as an individual in a faction is as important as the people fighting by your side . planetside 2 is a game best played when working with others , or simply causing havoc with your friends . xxmaj there 's no feeling that can compare to flying well above the ground in a gunship , firing off rounds from a xxmaj xxunk - an explosive cannon - upon the unsuspecting targets below . xxmaj well co - xxunk attacks see uncountable masses of tanks rolling across the continent , much to the defender 's disdain . xxmaj the sheer scale of planetside is impressive at its worst , spectacular at its best . xxmaj being a free - to - play xxup mmo , the war never ceases . xxmaj there is a vast pool of weapons , resources and upgrades at your disposal . xxmaj station cash makes for the inevitable real - world currency of an xxup mmo , allowing you to boost your experience or purchase vanity items . xxmaj everything else can be bought with xxmaj certs , a currency that is earned through play . xxmaj in the end , the experience you have or wish to have is entirely up to you .,xxbos i 've tried a few different mmos , and normally i burn out of them pretty fast ( tab targetting etc is not very engaging ) . xxmaj with xxmaj neverwinter i find the gameplay fun enough that i have managed to level up to 64 quite pleasantly . i am a big fan of xxmaj dungeons and xxmaj dragons , so it is a lot of fun to see monsters and locations from the famous xxmaj forgotten xxmaj realms setting . xxmaj the zones are mostly pretty cool to romp around in and i find the combat fun , which is good because almost all quests are of the kill x monsters type . i have set myself up with a controller by using a key mapping software called xxunk , which is working really well and lets me chill out and play it with controller , which it is designed for in any case . 64 levels in and i 've not spent a penny , which is pretty good !,xxbos xxmaj life traverse is exceptional for forceful shooters . xxmaj hardly a month goes by without new virtual fields xxunk up and appealing you into some fresh conflict , and only a few surely understood xxunk make sense of how to oversee dynamic player bases even a year after their hidden release . xxmaj what 's more , a short time later there 's xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 . xxmaj released in 2007 , this class - based commendable is so far going strong particularly into its seventh year , in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering . xxmaj since xxunk 's one of a kind xxup tf2 review , the entertainment has xxunk from different upgrades and made the skip to a permitted to - play plan of activity . xxmaj the middle action pits two xxunk of players against each other in a battle to get centers , move a truck , or take an organizer case . xxmaj the objective is always xxunk clear ; it 's the exchange between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting . xxmaj the convenient scout , the xxunk generous , the xxunk pro , the xxunk specialist , the irritating xxunk , the tricky see , the feisty pyro , the shaky trooper , and the fundamentally more - risky demoman all have exceptional weapons , attributes , and limits that supplement each other and xxunk in bundle ways . xxmaj encounters can vary xxunk depending upon the match sort and the xxunk of each gathering , and this xxunk is dire to xxup tf2 's long - standing xxunk . xxmaj when you leave the door as a mind - boggling with a specialist near to , you 're a forcing unfriendly xxunk , yet if a spy hovers around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pyro , it can all come xxunk in a matter of seconds . xxmaj master xxunk can cover expected foe ways , however rocket - ricocheting warriors have an ability for finding xxunk courses and raining dangerous going from above . xxmaj you may think you have an also fragile scout dead to rights , just to be xxunk by a baseball and beat the life out of . xxmaj as you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a quit xxunk of your cheerful killer , it 's hard not to chuckle at the sheer grouping of ways you can meet an unfavorable end . xxmaj besides , engaging jokes , insane outfits , and sensational host build up this sprightly tone . xxmaj clearly , this inside component has endured for by far most of xxup tf2 's future , so if you quit playing it two or three years earlier and return for a couple matches , you 'll find things are to a great degree surely understood . xxmaj taking in the ropes and getting the hang of your picked part is still a delightful information , and acing pushed frameworks does n't just make you deadlier ; it gives you more options for how to approach fight . xxmaj keeping your choices open is still xxunk too , in light of the way that being versatile with your choice of character can help you refrain from ending up on a xxunk imbalanced squad . xxmaj it is xxmaj team xxmaj fortress , taking all things into account . xxmaj regardless , however there is much that has stayed steady about the inside redirection , there have been some noticeable changes consistently , and moreover ordinary xxunk of new weapons and things . xxmaj of the few things available in the online store , some can be opened through play , while others must be acquired with genuine money . xxmaj from little xxunk that cost not precisely a dollar to huge packs that cost hundreds , there 's a broad assortment of ways to deal with adjust your experience . xxmaj some of the things offer just a vigorous twist on the entertainment 's starting now xxunk toon snappy . xxmaj you can buy tops , shirts , shoes , and other xxunk gear to xxunk up like a character from xxmaj adult xxmaj swim or wear spooky xxunk xxunk that you can wear just in the midst of xxmaj halloween or a full moon . xxmaj notwithstanding the likelihood that you do n't support spending for any of this stuff , it 's diverting to see some visual grouping as you endeavor to light your adversaries on fire . xxmaj the best difference from the redirection 's beginnings comes in the accommodating mode , xxmaj mann versus xxmaj machine . xxmaj in it , you and a few other human players must maintain a strategic distance from swarms of xxunk incarnations of xxup tf2 's classes from passing on a bomb to your base . xxmaj the money you pick up from xxunk robots can be spent on mid - organize climbs to your qualities and weaponry , which can be essential to accomplishment . xxmaj for sure , even on the most easy level , the robot armed forces are adequately wild to test the guts of a messy gathering . xxmaj this is a mode where absolutely xxunk weapon choices and defensive frameworks can mean the xxunk among succeeding and attempting , endeavor xxunk . xxmaj you can play this mode to no end , yet you wo n't be met all requirements to increase exceptional prizes or complete difficulties unless you pay a dollar for a xxmaj tour of xxmaj duty ticket . xxmaj notwithstanding the way that it does n't have the xxunk xxunk of centered play , the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately committed to see it through . xxmaj however , xxunk is the honest to goodness draw , and the xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 gathering can completely be engaged . xxmaj on a couple of servers , you might be scolded for xxunk cracks of xxunk , while on others , you might be welcomed with pleasing tips and xxunk . xxmaj you can even demand help on particular servers and be xxunk with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tips through talk . xxmaj the society around xxup tf2 is a charming one , not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight , yet for their imaginative attempts in arranging new weapons , things , and maps that have since ended up being a bit of the experience . xxmaj it feels like a gathering of managers , without whom the delight may well have dwindled away and gone into obsolete nature years earlier . xxmaj staying imperative even a year after release is extraordinary for an engaged shooter , yet , here 's xxmaj team xxmaj fortress 2 , still xxunk after seven years in the business . xxmaj every so often it feels like comparable diversion you could have played back then , and at various times it feels like no one will ever extremely nail class - based shooter competition the way xxup tf2 does . xxmaj the experience has created during the time without exchanging off what made it so extraordinary regardless , so however your permitted to - play choices may have extended altogether in the past couple of years , there are few that do it furthermore xxmaj team xxmaj fortress xxunk reviews are retrieved from the xxmaj internet and xxunk through a succession of xxunk tools three times both for humour and to save time . xxmaj in my religion , this is known as xxunk ) , but you can call it \" xxmaj xxunk \" ),xxbos i was excited about this game on steam . xxmaj free to play and all , awesome . i had played this back when if was first released on my phone , and i enjoyed it . xxmaj it had a short life back then , but it was good . xxmaj that being said , i still enjoy it , but with one small issue that has ruined it for me . xxmaj radscorpions . xxmaj they are so op that it makes the game not as fun , and more frustrating . i end up rushing a room , and getting one of those little b xxrep 5 * ds . xxmaj they drain my energy below xxunk , which renders my xxunk rooms un - capable of producing anything . xxmaj they have very hard to kill , they move randomly . i usually end up with 4 - 5 dead dwellers . xxmaj after the attack i am usually out of xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj so i have to rush rooms just to gain back enough energy to keep my dwellers alive , and i get another xxunk xxmaj radscorpion . xxmaj maybe introduce them later into the game , when at least all my dwellers have weapons ? xxmaj but as of right now , i wo n't be playing for awhile . i am annoyed and frustrated . xxmaj otherwise , i do like the updates , the missions are cool . xxmaj the new rooms are fun . xxmaj being able to build weapons and outfits gives the game depth . xxmaj if they made xxunk less powerful and random , i will come back , until then xxunk .\n",

xxunk you have low internet speed , you ca n't play xxunk - of - game chat is a xxunk , the game is awesome , but the multiplayer system around it needs some work .,xxbos xxmaj early xxmaj access reviewthis game is absolutely amazing . xxmaj it 's my most played game and i enjoy playing all day everyday . xxmaj brawlhalla is rather polished for something still in the beta - ish stages , obviously needing more updates to further increase it 's general greatness . xxmaj i'm a diamond player and really enjoy playing with my xxunk definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a game to have there on the side at the cost of nothing ( although i ve spent about $ xxunk xxup xxunk on cosmetics xd ) it is definitely the best free to play small little game in my xxunk problem however i commonly encounter is the somewhat toxic community , yes there are really friendly people but most of the time people tend to say something nasty if you win or loose regardless , i guess that 's just what happens with these types of games : alot of salty players . xxmaj other than that . legendary game for all i 'd say . but of course if you 're not into this sort of game then obviously you would n't like it : xxunk for me , i 'm a 2v2 competitive player ranking # 1 aus and top 30 xxunk several times throughout seasons 1 - 6 , however casual play is just as fun if you want to create your own mini - rules , which i have personally experienced before . xxmaj try doing xxmaj no sigs , only sigs , or just playing your worst legends with some friends , xxmaj brawlhalla is not limited to the conventional fighting , you can even xxunk some bots ! : dedit : i would like to say that i 'm doing this edit as of now to get my badge for the steam autumn sales and whatnot , however i did nominate it for the \" no apologies \" award as i feel many people feel negatively about this game ( possible because of their lack of skill xxup ;d ) and i would like to say xxunk that i still love the game although i have nt played a whole lot in general across the recent months .,xxbos xxmaj infestation | xxmaj the xxunk you read , i would like to say that i have over 300 hours on this game before steam release . xxmaj infestation | xxmaj the newz , is an official rework of the original ( and bad ) title xxmaj infestation | xxmaj survivor xxmaj stores , formerly known as xxmaj the warz , xxmaj the newz is being worked on by a whole new development team called xxmaj fredaikis xxup ab , xxmaj there is not a single dev from the original xxup iss on this development team . xxmaj everyone knows xxmaj the warz and how bad the game was . xxmaj it was riddled with hackers , xxmaj it was xxup seriously pay to win , loot was rare , so it made hackers even more populated , xxmaj it was full of bugs that devs did not patch , and lets be honest ... there was no content . xxmaj all there was to do is xxunk ... on the other hand , xxmaj fredaikis xxup ab , the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did , xxmaj they are listening to the community , and trying their best to make a game that you guys want . xxmaj they have released an anticheat called xxup mlg anticheat , xxup this anticheat was designed xxup just for this game , i have over 300 hours before steam and i have only got cheated xxup once . i repeat xxunk to the lack of content the previous game had , they made about 10 different xxup pvp server maps , so you can hop into it and xxup pvp right away , they made a custom xxup br , xxmaj they added airdrops , ( these drop about every hour ) on official servers , xxmaj they have revamped the xxup ui , they have added xxup alot of guns that the original xxup iss did not have . and armor , helmets etc . xxup and xxup they xxup added xxup skins <3 xxmaj traders dream ! xxmaj they have completely removed the xxmaj pay 2 win aspect of the game , now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market . xxmaj they have not removed ( xxup gc ) xxmaj gold credits , you can use this to purchase a private server to loot , or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place . xxup this xxup is xxup just xxup to xxup support xxup this xxup game xxup and xxup keep xxup it xxunk of you guys need to understand , they need to have a few things they can make money off of . a game is not free , they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that 10,000 people are playing on .,xxbos i have never considered giving this game anything but praise until now . xxmaj now i 'm voting with my review to try and urge valve to bring back quickplay and casual pubs into the game . xxmaj not this xxrep 6 ♥ overwatch / any - xxunk xxrep 4 ♥ ing - shooter lobby based queueing xxrep 7 ♥ t. i do n't give a xxrep 4 ♥ how low the queue times are it still takes up to two minutes between games just for server connection . i used to only have to do that after literal hours of fun on whatever map i chose . xxmaj good players , bad players , tryhards , friendlies . xxmaj all together . xxmaj all having fun on whatever map they wanted . xxmaj in whatever region they wanted , for as long as they wanted without any queueing or connecting . xxmaj this change is utter insanity . xxmaj everyone was excited about matchmaking but i doubt a single person was hoping they would replace the xxup entire game with it . xxmaj for xxup years xxunk has been my favorite activity . xxmaj the only thing in my life that guaranteed fun and an escape from xxrep 7 ♥ t. i xxunk when i was happy , sad , lonely or with friends laughing and having fun . xxmaj this game is the most important activity is my life and has been since i started playing 5 years ago . xxmaj pubs have always been my place to just go and be free and have fun without a worry or care beyond that tryhard soldier i 'm trying to stop from dominating me , or the free to play xxunk that crit me to death with his wrench . xxmaj this game can be very competitive and i enjoy that aspect , but above all else it is fun . xxmaj it has to stay fun . xxmaj please xxmaj valve . xxmaj please give us back the best part of this game .,xxbos xxmaj hmm well this game is xxunk bad or good depending what you 're looking for . xxmaj social experience , lacking but present , community is nice but absent minded , questing is solo - oriented but there is group quests as well , xxmaj zen market where you buy stuff is rediculously overpriced no one would buy anything from there unless a steep , steep , very steep incentive / sale was on , however most anything you need can be bought with diamonds / gold ; there 's a lack of ingame xxunk that must be overcome by strong inventory management from the get - xxunk becomes less annoying once you learn what to sell / keep / stack ) not to mention this is an xxup mmo and its a xxunk version of that ( you can play this game even the xxup pc version with a controller using xxmaj xpadder xxunk software and it works great really smooth actually no complaints there - its sad the lazy developers have n't offered this yet to the xxup pc hardcore fans that do n't know how to setup xxmaj xpadder on their own ) which caters to xxunk button configurations etc . so its easy to pick up and play . xxmaj would i suggest caution on spending money on this game ? xxmaj in the xxup zen store for example ? xxmaj yes . xxmaj the prices are inflated and you do n't get much value there . xxmaj pathetic really . xxmaj it puts the developer in a bad light , prices are so high no one can understand xxunk motive except to cater to a certain xxunk meanwhile no one plays the game because those that would pay a small $ 10 or $ 20 in the xxmaj zen store are discouraged because believe it or not , that wo n't buy you xxrep 6 ♥ for this game . xxmaj we 're talking hundreds of dollers to get anything worthwhile . xxmaj pathetic . xxmaj the developers are out of tough , its all i can think of to say . i think they are completely wrong in their approach . xxmaj stay away from the xxmaj zen store . xxmaj that said , you can play at least 2 character slots for free , the quests are well designed , most everything is voiced over , its an xxup mmo so there 's tons to do from crafting to questing , to pvp to dungeon crawling its all here etc . xxmaj you can play the game entirely for free and there 's a bunch of cool classes but you 're limited by 2 character slots unless you pay 300 xxmaj zen for another ( that s a rediculous cost ) so yea except for that its all good here . xxmaj if you want to pick up and play and have fun with some xxup d&d you can do so in a variety of ways no issues here . xxmaj its the overall structure of the game that suffers ( forcing you to spend money in the xxmaj zen store but really you do n't have to but you could its what 's backward here there is little xxunk between free and paid ) . xxmaj do i recommend this game ? xxmaj sure , the strong graphics , sound , action - oriented combat ( its like xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj xxunk without the blocking mechanic or xxup gw2 ) its fine and deep skill trees , the xxup d&d settings and ruleset , the variety of character classes however the xxmaj zen store and marketing scheme of this game is xxup bad so you must choose caution here . xxmaj xxunk community pressure will change their approach , but for now you put up with it . xxmaj you can play this game completely free , its worth a play through at least . xxmaj how it lasts or endgame ? xxmaj well lets just say they 're working on that . xxmaj its a thumbs up for now but i might change my mind in the future . xxmaj so far hours of free fun , i 've spent no money on this game and my experience has not suffered all that much though i think it is somewhat a pay - to - win structure .\n",
